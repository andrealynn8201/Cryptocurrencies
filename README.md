# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of this assignment was to understand what unsupervised machine learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce the dimensions and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. By using these models from machine learning, I was bale to create an analysis for clients whoa are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.
